The main parts of !Python4Delphi are:

 # !PythonEngine.pas 
 A collection of relatively low-level routines for communicating with Python, creating
 Python types in Delphi etc.
 # !VarPyth.pas
 Very high-level and convenient use of Python objects in Delphi using custom variants.
 # !WrapDelphi classes
 Units that allow easy manipulation of standard GUI Delphi objects in Python scripts.

All parts of !Python4Delphi now work in !FPC.  The only limitation is that due to an FPC issue with variants (http://mantis.freepascal.org/view.php?id=20849) you will find !VarPyth has problems in converting Python Variants to native types and variants.
