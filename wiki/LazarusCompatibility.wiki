= FPC-Lazarus compatibility  =

The main parts of !Python4Delphi are:

 # !PythonEngine.pas 
 A collection of relatively low-level routines for communicating with Python, creating
 Python types in Delphi etc.
 # !VarPyth.pas
 Very high-level and convenient use of Python objects in Delphi using custom variants.
 # !WrapDelphi classes
 Units that allow easy manipulation of standard GUI Delphi objects in Python scripts.

All parts of !Python4Delphi now work in FPC-Lazarus Win32.  The only limitation is that due to an FPC issue with variants (http://mantis.freepascal.org/view.php?id=20849) you will find !VarPyth has problems in converting Python Variants to native types and variants.

MacOSX and Linux compatibility has not been tested. Please test and if required submit a patch.
